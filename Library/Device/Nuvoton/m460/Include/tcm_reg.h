     * |        |          |(default: 0) When a TCM way is configured as a cache-way, setting this bit to 1 enables the write-back/write-allocate cache management policy
     * |        |          |Otherwise, a 0 in this bit enables the write-through/no-write-allocate policy
     * |        |          |This bit can be modified only when none of the TCM ways is enabled as a cache-way.
     * |[5]     |FIXAZERO  |Fix Auto Zero (Read Only)
     * |        |          |(default: 0) Asserting this bit to 1 to prohibit update of the AutoZero bits in the TCM way configuration registers by the core
     * |        |          |The default 0 setting allows them to be modified
     * |        |          |This bit itself is not modifiable by the core

     * |        |          |It is not fully disabled until both AutoFlushing and AutoZeroing bits are 0
     * |        |          |When CacheMode bit is 1, the TCM way is not fully enabled until the Invalidating bit is 0, and not fully disabled until the AutoZeroing bit is 0.

     * |        |          |Note: This bit can be modified only when the corresponding WAYxEN bit is clear
     * |[1]     |PRELD     |Pre-load the TCM way
     * |        |          |When CacheMode bit is clear, setting this bit to 1 instructs TCM control to pre-load the TCM way according to the size/addr setting in the corresponding DMA register
     * |        |          |The TCM way is not enabled as a LMB until the preloading operation is completed
     * |        |          |When CacheMode is set, this bit has no meaning
     * |        |          |This bit can be modified only when the corresponding WayEnable bit is clear.
     * |[2]     |PRELDST   |Pre-loading Status
     * |        |          |This is a status bit that returns 1 when the pre-loading of the TCM way (as a LMB) is on-going
     * |        |          |Until this bit is clear, the TCM way is not fully enabled to serve I-/D-bus requests as a LMB
     * |        |          |An access request to the would-be-mapped address range will be wait-stated to avoid the multi-caching scenario that can happens when another TCM way is enabled as a cache-way and the requested target can become cached there because the I-/D-bus request is not blocked.
     * |[3]     |INVALST   |Invalidation Status
     * |        |          |This is a status bit that returns 1 when the pre-enabling invalidation of the TCM way (as a cache-way) is on-going
     * |        |          |Until this bit is clear, the TCM way is not fully enabled to serve I-/D-bus requests as a cache-way
     * |        |          |However, since no multi-caching scenario can occur, no any incoming request is blocked due the on-going invalidation.
     * |[4]     |AFLUSH    |auto-flush the data array
     * |        |          |When CacheMode is clear, setting this bit to 1 instructs TCM control to auto-flush the data array according to the size/addr setting in the corresponding DMA register
     * |        |          |When CacheMode is set, this bit has no meaning
     * |        |          |The data array is always fully flushed when a TCM way is disabled from a write-back/write-allocate cache way
     * |        |          |The TCM way is not fully disabled until the flushing operation is completed
     * |        |          |This bit can be modified only when the corresponding WayEnable bit is clear.
     * |[5]     |AFLUSHST  |This is a status bit that returns 1 when auto-flushing of the TCM way is on-going. The auto-flushing is triggered when the TCM way is disabled as a LMB with the AutoFlush bit set, or when the TCM way is disabled as a cache-way and the cache is configured with write-back/write-allocate. Until this bit is clear, a TCM way is not fully disabled. While it is set, accesses to targets residing in the TCM way are wait-stated. This can occur when the TCM way is configured as a LMB and the target falls in the mapped address range, or when the TCM way is configured as a cache-way in general. The blocking is to avoid memory consistency issue when a late arrival write access, whose target data has been flushed out to the memory.
     * |[6]     |AZERO     |Setting this bit to 1 instructs TCM control to auto-zero a TCM way when it is to be disabled as either a LMB or a cache-way. Auto-zeroing of a LMB is not controlled by the size/addr setting in DMA_control register. The whole TCM way is zerou2019ed out. This bit is reset-configurable like FixAutoZero bit when PORESETn is high and SYSRESETn is low. After that, it is modifiable by the core only if the FixAutoZero bit is clear and the corresponding WayEnable bit is also clear.
     * |[7]     |AZEROST   |Auto-zeroing Status
     * |        |          |This is a status bit that returns 1 when auto-zeroing is on-going
     * |        |          |Similar to AutoFlushing bit
     * |        |          |Accesses with target potentially residing in the TCM way are all wait-stated.
     * |[8]     |XOMERROR  |XOM Error Flag
     * |        |          |This is a status bit that returns 1 when the TCM way is configured as a LMB and is currently mapping a XOM region
     * |        |          |This bit is read-only by the core
     * |        |          |It is set/cleared automatically by the TCM logic.

     * |        |          |When TCM way configure as LMB used, these bits define the base address of the mapped region
     * |        |          |This tag is compared against the incoming address to determine if the address hits in the LMB.

     * |        |          |Until this bit is clear, the TCM way is not fully enabled to serve I-/D-bus requests as a LMB
     * |        |          |An access request to the would-be-mapped address range will be wait-stated to avoid the multi-caching scenario that can happens when another TCM way is enabled as a cache-way and the requested target can become cached there because the I-/D-bus request is not blocked.

     * |        |          |When CacheMode is clear, setting this bit to 1 instructs TCM control to auto-flush the data array according to the size/addr setting in the corresponding DMA register

     * |        |          |This bit can be modified only when the corresponding WayEnable bit is clear.
     * |[5]     |AFLUSHST  |This is a status bit that returns 1 when auto-flushing of the TCM way is on-going. The auto-flushing is triggered when the TCM way is disabled as a LMB with the AutoFlush bit set, or when the TCM way is disabled as a cache-way and the cache is configured with write-back/write-allocate. Until this bit is clear, a TCM way is not fully disabled. While it is set, accesses to targets residing in the TCM way are wait-stated. This can occur when the TCM way is configured as a LMB and the target falls in the mapped address range, or when the TCM way is configured as a cache-way in general. The blocking is to avoid memory consistency issue when a late arrival write access, whose target data has been flushed out to the memory.
