# M460 Series CMSIS BSP

To experience the powerful features of M460 in few minutes, please refer to NuMaker-PFM-M460 Board Quick Start Guide. You can select the sample code of your interest to download and execute on the M460 board. You can open the project files to build them with Keil速 MDK, IAR or Eclipse, and then download and trace them on the M460 board to see how it works.
